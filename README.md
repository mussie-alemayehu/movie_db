# movie_db

This is an application built using the Flutter framework.

The application allows users to explore the latest movies across different 
categories such as popular, upcoming, and top-rated. Users can easily search for 
specific movies by title and access related videos like trailers, clips, behind the 
scenes, and featurettes. Additionally, users can read reviews to make informed 
decisions about which movies to watch.

The movies in the app are provided by The Movies DB APIs. (https://www.themoviedb.org/)
